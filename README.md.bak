# Waveguide-Analytical

Analytical, semi-analytical and easily implemented non-analytical algorithms for calculating modes of hollow-core, step-index and graded-index fibres.

Specifically:
- A one-dimensional finite difference solver for calculating the modes in a graded index fibre, originally implemented by Joel Carpenter.
- An adapted version of Joel Carpenter's one dimensional finite difference solver for calcualting modes in a step index fibre, implemented by me.
- A mostly-analytical approach to calculating modes of a step index fibre, based on Gloge's paper.
- An implementation of Archambault's of anti-resonant photonic crystal fibres
- An implementation of Litchinitser's model of anti-resonant photonic crystal fibres
- An implementation of the Marcatali-Schmelzer model of hollow waveguides
- A model for modelling planar waveguides
